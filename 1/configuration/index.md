## Versioning
You can pass the `versions` parameter with true and you will be able to create folders inside your docs folder. Techdocs will then determine based on the numbers with is the newest to display to users in the navigation.

## Multilingal
You projects might also require you to translate your documentation into other languages. You can pass an array into the `lang` parameter with all the languages you support. The first item in the array will be displayed in the menu.
